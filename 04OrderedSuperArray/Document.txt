I created a tester class to test whether the sorting method works.
I added random words into SuperArray tester.
It prints out the unsorted array. 
Right before it sorts it, it records the start time from System.nanoTime().
Then, I insertSort().
As soon as its done, it records the ends time. 
The speed of the method is printed as the difference between the start and end time. 
Then I repeat that same procedure for badInsertionSort().
Thus, I compare the times.
